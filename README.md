Assignment : 1

Python Task submission 

Task1: Problem Statement: Write a Python program that does the following:
1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
o	Addition
o	Subtraction
o	Multiplication
o	Division
3.  Displays the results of each operation on the screen.


Solution: 

  1) We have to take two variable which store user input value and convert it into integer. Because by default eveery input is in the form of string.
  2) We implement airthmatic operation on it.


 Task2: 

   Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.  Takes a user's first name and last name as input.
2.  Concatenates the first name and last name into a full name.
3.  Prints a personalized greeting message using the full name.

Solution: 
  
  1) We take first name from user using input funtion and store in a variable.
  2) We take last name from user using input funtion and store in a variable.
  3) Concatenates first name and last name with addition operator and save it into another variable.
  4) print the message

Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
   Problem Statement:  Write a Python program that:
   1. 	Takes an integer input from the user.
   2. 	Checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement.
   3. 	Displays the result accordingly.
   
   Solution:
   
   1. We take input from users.
   2. If number is divide by 2 then number is even. If not then number is odd. 
   

Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop
 
     Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
     1.   Uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
     2.   Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.
     3.   Displays the final sum.
     
     Solution:
     
     1. In this task we have already defined range 1 to 50
     2. total_sum variable by default 0 . When it enter into the for loop then its value change until we reched our final range value.
